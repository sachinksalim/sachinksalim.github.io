<!-- An increasing influx of neural data necessitates the creation of foundational machine learning models capable of interpreting this neural activity. I intend to work on developing deep learning frameworks to model the population dynamics of neural activity across diverse, large-scale neural recordings. Further down my career, I aspire to set up a research lab that addresses the interdisciplinary challenge of developing novel neural decoders that enhance control speed and precision, bolster system reliability, and extend the overall functionality of **Brain Machine Interfaces**. -->
