    The course was at the intersection of economics and computer science, involving advanced mathematics. Sachin stood out with his thoughtful participation and strong grasp of complex topics. Our discussions during and after class helped shape my teaching approach. His project work further demonstrated his research potential, and I’m confident in his ability to contribute meaningfully to academic or industry research roles.
