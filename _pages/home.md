As a researcher at Draelos Lab, I explore automated behavioral analysis methods focusing on octopus arm movements, utilizing real-time, low-latency methods with deep-learning based kinematic features and streaming dimension reduction. This aligns with my passion for the intersection of **neuroscience and machine learning**, which I also pursue through my academic studies at the University of Michigan.
